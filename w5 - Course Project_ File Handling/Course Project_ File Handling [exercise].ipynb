This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. File handling plays a key role in being able to manage such data, and Python allows us to handle various file formats which are used to store such data.\n","\n","In this project, we are going to learn how to load, modify, and save files of three popular file formats which are used in the industry to handle data. These formats are:\n","\n","- **CSV**: CSV or comma-separated value files come with the file suffix *.csv* and, as the name suggests, have data values separated by commas. Each data entry is placed on a new line, and typically, the first line tends to store the names of columns. In our dataset, a CSV file is used to store sales values for each product over 14 days.\n","\n","- **JSON**: JSON or JavaScript object notation files come with the file suffix *.json* and store data as key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in Python. In our dataset, JSON files are used to store details such as product names, prices, and brands.\n","\n","- **TXT**: TXT or text files come with the file suffix *.txt* and generally useful for storing single variables like strings or integers. In our dataset, TXT files are used to store descriptions of products."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_bIkNbC2z8oL"},"source":["# Problem Statement\n","The goal is to read data from popular file formats (.csv, .txt, .json), to perform operations on this data, and to finally save this modified data into the original file formats."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Data Description\n","The dataset for this project has been provided in the *mainfolder.zip* file.

The columns *Day1* through *Day14* represent the sales figures for each consecutive day.\n","\n","- **Product Descriptions** (*product_descriptions* folder): This folder contains text files, each corresponding to a specific product identified by the SKU in the filename (e.g., *description_AISJDKFJW93NJ.txt*). These files provide descriptive information about the products.\n","\n","- **Product Details** (*product_details* folder): This folder includes JSON files, again with filenames corresponding to product SKUs (e.g., *details_AISJDKFJW93NJ.json*).
